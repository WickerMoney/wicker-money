## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **M3, import and categorization.** `plugins/import-csv`: saved column mapping
  per source, explicit date format with live parse preview, duplicate detection,
  batch undo. Categories page with rules (with a preview before a rule touches
  anything), and triage on the Transactions page.
- **M2, the shell and the first plugin.** Real web host with sign-in, navigation
  and a dashboard fed entirely by plugins over Module Federation. Per-plugin
  database roles derived from each manifest's `requiredTables`.
- **M1, auth and ledger.** Users, sessions, accounts, categories, category rules,
  transactions and splits, all under row-level security. Account balances are
  derived from the ledger, never stored.
- Budgets plugin with per-category budgets and per-line rollover.
- Container image (amd64 and arm64) served by the API on a single port.
- `ui-kit`: a shared, validated chart palette (`--wm-chart-1` … `-6`,
  `--wm-chart-other`, plus chart surface, ink and grid tokens). The bundled
  chart plugins alias it instead of carrying their own copies.

### Changed

- `ui-kit`: `--wm-accent` is now the brand green from the logo (`#2e500d`
  light, `#a9d173` dark) instead of blue, with dark-mode `--wm-accent-text`
  switched to a dark ink so text on the accent stays readable.
  `--wm-positive` shifts toward teal (`#0c7e65` / `#29a987`) so a link and a
  gain no longer look alike.

### Security

- Migration 009: composite `(user_id, ...)` keys close a cross-user hole where a
  foreign key could attach a transaction to another user's account.
